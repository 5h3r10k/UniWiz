 This course is a Pre-requisite for the Following Courses: 
01:198:452 - Formal Languages and Automata

 Topics: 
Methods for expressing and comparing complexity of algorithms: worst and average cases, lower bounds on algorithm classes, verification of correctness. Application of such analysis to variety of specific algorithms: searching, merging, sorting (including quick and heap internal and Fibonacci external sorts); graph problems (including connected components, shortest path, minimum spanning tree. and biconnected components); language problems (including string matching and parsing).Consideration of a number of hard problems: knapsack, satisfiability, traveling salesman problems.Development of NP-complete classification and its consequence.Approximation algorithms.

 Expected Work: 
Regular exercises, (about) 6 small programs

 Exams: 
Short quizzes, midterm and final exam  (See Instructor's Class URL for more details)

 Learning Goals: 
Computer Science majors ...

will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; algorithmic principles).


will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field.


will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate school), a programming project (for those going into the software industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into startups).
