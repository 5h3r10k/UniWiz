 Description: 
The course explores how computation in the human brain can be effectively modeled across the main levels of abstraction (from a single neuron to biological neural networks and system; introduces a time-sensitive computational formalization of brain function based on the model of neuron as a Spike Processing Machine – Spike Neural Networks (SNNs); and employs neuro-mimetic or neuro-inspired SNNs to tackle a problem in a term-wide project. The aim of this course is to provide the student with a solid foundation in the field.
