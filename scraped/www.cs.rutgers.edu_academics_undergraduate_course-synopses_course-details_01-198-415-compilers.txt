- A grade below a "C" in a prerequisite course will not satisfy that prerequisite requirement.

 Course Links: 
01:198:211 - Computer Architecture, 01:198:314 - Principles of Programming Languages

 Topics: 
CompilersMethods of language specificationLexical analysisTop-down (recursive descent) and bottom-up (LR) parsing methodsSemantics-driven translationCode generationSymbol tables and intermediate code formsProcedures and run time stacksRecursion implementationCode Optimization

 Expected Work: 
Work will consist primarily of a large programming project, usually the implementation of a working compiler for a simulated abstract machine.  Some additional written homework will be assigned.  Previous knowledge of C or C++  will be useful.

 Exams: 
A midterm and a final examination

 Learning Goals: 
Computer Science majors ...

will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; algorithmic principles).


will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field.


will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate school), a programming project (for those going into the software industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into startups).
