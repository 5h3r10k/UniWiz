Physics courses 01:750:203,204,205,206 (or 123,124,227,229; or 271,272,275,276; or 201,202; or 193,194), or Chemistry courses 01:160:159,160,171 (or 161,162,171; or 163,164,171).
No more than one grade of D can be accepted in courses applied toward the major.
Residency condition: At least seven of the (required and elective) courses used to satisfy the requirements of the BS degree must be courses taken in the New Brunswick Department of Computer Science. (i.e., they must be 01:198:xxx.)
All CS electives required for the BA/BS degree must be completed in the last 10 years from the date of the undergraduate degree

These requirements can be satisfied with 68-71 credit hours (depending on whether 3 or 4 credit electives are taken.) Notes:

The above requirements apply to all current computer science majors. Prior to fall 2011, the BS required either 01:198:113 or 214, plus 314 and 416. Students now have the option of substituting other electives for these courses.
Courses for which a student receives a grade of D cannot be used to satisfy prerequisite requirements.
Requirements to register for CS graduate classes is available on the CS Honors page.
