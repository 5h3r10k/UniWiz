 Description: 
The course studies the problems, methods, processes and tools involved in the development of large software systems that are reliable and maintainable, and meet their users' needs. This is carried out in the context of a significant, term-long multi-person team project.(In different semesters, this course would focus on either morestandard, centralized systems, or distributed systems. This wouldeffect, to some extent, the choice of topics to be taught (see below),and especially the techniques and tools to be used.)

 Topics: 
Software life cycle.  Requirements analysis and specification. Model-based software development.Software architectural design, and the design of its laws.Specification of software components and their interaction.Assertions, testing, and debugging.  Elementary projectplanning and estimation.  Some state of the art material.Specific techniques used in the above include software reuse throughlibraries (e.g., Java Swing, data structure libraries), CASE tools(e.g., Eclipse), notations (e.g., UML), access-control techniques fordistributed systems (LGI).

 Expected Work: 
The team project includes demonstrations of protoype and findal code, plus documents for specification, architectural design, detailed design, and test plan.

 Exams: 
Possibly a take-home exam/assignments, concerning material covered in lectures.

 Learning Goals: 
Computer Science majors ...

will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; algorithmic principles).


will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field.


will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate school), a programming project (for those going into the software industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into startups).
