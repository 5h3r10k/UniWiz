 Description: 
Computer Science concepts are relevant to many aspects of our lives, from explorations in the fields of science and medicine to digital creations in the fields of art and music. This course introduces students to the central ideas of computer science and explores technologies of computing and their impact on society and culture.  Students are introduced to web site design, data investigation and manipulation using spreadsheets, collaborative on-line tools, and fundamental computer programming concepts.  Students develop computational skills and are engaged in the creative aspects of problem solving through programming. Students investigate the global impacts and social implications of computing innovations, data, and the Internet through discussions, projects, and writing.
