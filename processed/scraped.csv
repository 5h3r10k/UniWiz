We tour the architecture of modern computers from bits and logic all the way up to programming languages and software libraries. We probe the insights in computability and algorithm design that make possible massive search engines like Google and help us understand the relation between computation and intelligence. Coursework primarily involves paper-and-pencil problem solving and a very small amount of programming to provide students with hands-on-experience with the concepts we introduce.

Examine examples of rushed and ad hoc findings  from so called “big data” in the news and on the web. Develop a “healthy skepticism” of claims you hear every day. Draw your own conclusions and make all your arguments stronger through our “Data and Society”  challenges. Consider questions of privacy, anonymity  vs personalization, and data ownership when we increasingly rely on online services.  And, develop marketable skills by learning basic programming tools to work with the data. This summer only we are offering a 3 credit hybrid version of our popular Data Literacy class (01:198:142).  We will meet once a week for a 3 hour period (except the first week when we will meet twice); the rest of the class will be run online - solving data puzzles and other online challenges.  We will also provide a flexible set of office hours for indiviual consultations. This class aims to provide you with a basic set of tools for data literacy as well as general view of the impact of data on society and elements of common sense data analysis and reasoning.   A significant piece of the class will be learning foundations of  “R”, which is a statistical software environment and programming language that we’ll use to analyze and visualize datasets.  Learning simple R will take some work; however, if you’re able to master the basics covered in this class, you’ll gain a concrete, marketable skill that may very well be extremely useful in your academic and professional life.    On the statistical side, we’ll cover basic topics from statistics and probability that are required to argue persuasively using data (a list of some of the topics to be covered can be found below).   This is not a “typical” Statistics 101 class; instead of covering an exhaustive list of topics and asking you to memorize many formulas, our goal is to focus only on the most important topics for convincingly analyzing data now by solving “hands on” weekly data puzzles. This class is taught in unique manner – students have to solve “data puzzles” (one or more weekly) and  defend their solutions in class in the so called “Court of Data”.  Students compete in the semester-long competition for the title of Data Masters (aggregated score for all data puzzles and the project) In the Final project, your data findings should have real consequences, preferably “actionable” and consequential in the real society.  Prerequisite Information: Placement in 01:640:026. Placement into Intermediate Algebra or higher, or completion of Math 025. No programing experience required. * This course may not be used toward CS major degree credit.

R is a statistical software environment and programming language that we’ll use to analyze and visualize datasets.  Learning simple R will take some work; however, if you’re able to master the basics covered in this class, you’ll gain a concrete, marketable skill that may very well be extremely useful in your academic and professional life.      On the statistical side, we’ll cover basic topics from statistics and probability that are required to argue persuasively using data (a list of some of the topics to be covered can be found below).   This is not a “typical” Statistics 101 class; instead of covering an exhaustive list of topics and asking you to memorize many formulas, our goal is to focus only on the most important topics for convincingly analyzing data now by solving “hands on” weekly data puzzles.   This class is taught in unique manner – students have to solve “data puzzles” (one or more weekly) and  defend their solutions in class in the so called “Court of Data”.     Students compete in the semester long competition for the titles of Data Masters (aggregated score for all data puzzles and the project)   One of the objectives of the class is to show the danger of false, random conclusions from data and learning right methodology of “healthy skepticism”.   We will also discuss how not to be fooled by data and show examples of rushed and ad hoc conclusions from so called “big data” in the news and on the web.  In addition we will examine both upside and downside of big data on the web.  We will talk about privacy, anonymity  vs personalization and data ownership when we increasingly rely on online services.   In Final project   your data findings should have real consequences, preferably “actionable” and consequential in the real society.   Video Intro: https://bit.ly/39KHFRj  Instructor Profile: Imielinski, Tomasz Prerequisite Information: Placement in 01:640:026. Placement into Intermediate Algebra or higher, or completion of Math 025. No programing experience required. * This course may not be used toward CS major degree credit. Expected Work: Weekly Data Puzzles, Presentations, Homeworks, Final Project Exams: Midterm exam and final exam Learning Goals: Analyze and critically assess information from traditional and emergent technologies - data analysis in meaningful way Apply effective and efficient mathematical or other formal processes to reason and to solve problems - finding patterns in data  Formulate, evaluate, and communicate conclusions and inferences from quantitative information - present and defend your results Analyze the relationship that science and technology have to a contemporary social issue   Contacts Departmental ChairUlrich Kremer Undergraduate DirectorSantosh Nagarakatte  Undergraduate Menu  Learning GoalsWhy Computer ScienceProspective StudentsMajor - BA DegreeMajor - BS DegreeMinor(s)Courses ScheduleCourse InformationCourse SynopsesAdvisingElectivesHonorsAcademic Integrity PolicyIntroductory Computer Science OfferingsComputer Science Course StructureAdmission to the MajorComputer Science Undergraduate Program TracksCS DegreesUndergraduate Student OrganizationsCourse Registration and Special Permission  Undergraduate Quicklinks  Academic Calendar Course Schedule Planner Degree Navigator MyMajor SAS Academic Advising SAS Core Curriculum University Schedule of Classes Web Registration System     Connect with Rutgers  Rutgers HomeRutgers TodaymyRutgersAcademic CalendarCalendar of EventsSAS Events   Explore SAS  Departments & Degree-Granting ProgramsMajors & MinorsResearch Programs, Centers, & InstitutesInternational ProgramsDivision of Life Sciences   Quick Links  We Are Hiring!

It is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to acquire and curate real word data, to explore the data to discover patterns and distributions, and to manage large datasets with databases. Students will learn the minimal aspects of Python as needed to acquire and curate datasets. Much of their work will be done using Python libraries that deliver maximum benefit with minimal programming effort: to get data from various online data sources online, detect which aspects of data are uncurated or unreliable and understand why it is so, learn various domain independent and domain dependent ways to curate the data, and get the curated data into a form that can be explored, managed and analyzed. Students will also learn how to get datasets into database-ready form and do basic analysis of such datasets using relational databases and SQL, and NoSQL databases. The course content is designed to be accessible to all SAS students regardless of their major. Although the course has CS 111 as one of the pre-requisites (for Computer Science students), it does not require students to have any programming experience, since in the other pre-requisite course (CS 142), students are only nominally exposed to R.  Prerequisite Information: Prerequisites: CS 142 (Data 101: Data Literacy) OR CS 111 (Introduction to Computer Science) Expected Work: To assess that students have acquired basic literacy in all the concepts, tools, and techniques they are taught, they will be given 6 quizzes periodically through the semester (typically bi-weekly), of which the lowest scoring quiz will be dropped for grading.  Students are expected to work on 4-5 homework assignments through the semester. These assignments are intended for the student to learn by doing—data management is very much a hands-on experience. By doing the assignments, students will learn firsthand how to seek out various data sources; get data from such sources; curate, structure, visualize/explore/discover, and manage such data. Each assignment will typically have a 2 to 3-week window for submission. The assignments will be done either individually or in groups.  Students will be required to do one course project, in groups. They will start working on the project midway through the semester. Each group will elect to pick one rich data source from which they will acquire data, curate/structure/explore the data, and present the results of their analysis and discovery. Each group will be required to use a particular subset of concepts and tools they have learned in the course that most effectively apply to their choice of data source and dataset. Student groups will submit their project in incremental stages, each of which will be graded with feedback to keep them on track for successful completion.  The final exam will assess the student’s ability to put together the concepts and tools they have learned in the course in solving a range of very particular and localized data management problems arising in various real-world scenarios. Notes: Text/Resources No required text. Content for the Python part of the course will be made available via Jupyter notebooks, online documentation (usage samples and APIs accessible from within Jupyter notebooks, and other external sites), and various online data sources.    Contacts Departmental ChairUlrich Kremer Undergraduate DirectorSantosh Nagarakatte  Undergraduate Menu  Learning GoalsWhy Computer ScienceProspective StudentsMajor - BA DegreeMajor - BS DegreeMinor(s)Courses ScheduleCourse InformationCourse SynopsesAdvisingElectivesHonorsAcademic Integrity PolicyIntroductory Computer Science OfferingsComputer Science Course StructureAdmission to the MajorComputer Science Undergraduate Program TracksCS DegreesUndergraduate Student OrganizationsCourse Registration and Special Permission  Undergraduate Quicklinks  Academic Calendar Course Schedule Planner Degree Navigator MyMajor SAS Academic Advising SAS Core Curriculum University Schedule of Classes Web Registration System     Connect with Rutgers  Rutgers HomeRutgers TodaymyRutgersAcademic CalendarCalendar of EventsSAS Events   Explore SAS  Departments & Degree-Granting ProgramsMajors & MinorsResearch Programs, Centers, & InstitutesInternational ProgramsDivision of Life Sciences   Quick Links  We Are Hiring!

The course stresses learning how to use tools such as debuggers, profilers, source version control systems, and integrated development environments as an essential part of developing large programs. The course also stresses the understanding of how programs execute on today's computers and how to measure and optimize performance. Programming will be in C on Unix systems to introduce students to a new programming eco system, as well as enable the mapping of high-level language constructs to the underlying machine.

Video Intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8mscslfb-o  Instructor Profile: Zhu, He Prerequisite Information: 01:198:211 or 14:332:331; 01:198:205 or 14:332:312; 01:640:152. - A grade below a ""C"" in a prerequisite course will not satisfy that prerequisite requirement.   Course Links: 01:198:205 - Introduction to Discrete Structures I, 01:198:211 - Computer Architecture Topics: BNF and context free grammars; Data visibility (i.e., lexical and dynamic scoping);  Procedures and  parameter passing techniques; Types, type checking and type equivalence; Functional programming paradigm: higher-order functions, recursive data structures, programming with recursion (i.e., without iteration);  Logic programming paradigm:  unification, generate and test;  Programming with pointers in C. Expected Work: There are three graded programming projects and textbook homework assignments. Exams: 1 hourly, Final Exam Learning Goals: Computer Science majors ... will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; algorithmic principles). will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field. will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate school), a programming project (for those going into the software industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into startups).

We will discuss the social impacts of algorithmic decisions, their legal implications, and the need for transparency and accountability in algorithmic decision-making. The class will cover topics such as bias in data and processes, fairness, game theory, and trust, as they relate to algorithms. The class will focus on hands-on projects and discussions that will give students an understanding of a participatory design, and include them as stakeholders of the algorithms they are implementing. The course will give students a critical understanding of the often-competing goals of efficiency and optimization with those of transparency, accountability and fairness, which are necessary for trust and widespread adoption of automated decision systems. It will teach them to consider all stakeholders of a decision process, as well as the broader impacts of their algorithmic designs.  Prerequisite Information: The prerequisites are 01:198:210 or 01:198:112 and knowledge of Python, or by permission of instructor. - A grade below a ""C"" in a prerequisite course will not satisfy that prerequisite requirement.

For students interested in exploring social, ethical,scientific, and practical implications of the recentweb-based technologies and systems. Video Intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMLSsVgKus  Instructor Profile: Kulikowski, Casimir Prerequisite Information: Any Course from Computer Science; Any Course from Anthropology or Any Course from Sociology or Any Course from Political Science or Any Course from Philosophy; Senior Standing. Topics: How do computers and related technologies affect us as individuals and as members of societies? How has technological enablement changed the human ecological niche, and how are computers now changing it? We will consider the differences between automation and information technologies and how they affect work, education, and leisure activities in society. The effect of information on relationships among individuals and groups in the workplace, in business, government, the media, health, law, education, and other social activities will be critically examined, raising questions about tradeoffs between personal/group opportunities and social responsibilities and the need for ""computer ethics"". The role of the web and distributed world-wide computing in economic and scientific development will be discussed, together with security,privacy and confidentiality issues that arise to challenge societal and individual decision-making. The increasing application of ""smart machines"" using artifical intelligence techniques will be assessed, and some of the underlying mind/brain vs. machine issues explored. The the course will also study emerging computational technologies such as virtual reality and artificial life and their societal implications.

Video Intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39lwCgCXmEc  Instructor Profile: Aanjaneya, Mridul Prerequisite Information: For students considering a career involving graphics, a course in numerical analysis, such as 01:198:323, is recommended. 01:198:112 or 14:332:351; CALC2; 01:640:250. Credit not given for this course and14:332:474. † This course is available for CS Graduate degree credit. - A grade below a ""C"" in a prerequisite course will not satisfy that prerequisite requirement. Course Links: 01:198:112 - Data Structures Topics: This course is combination of algorithms, numerical methods, representations of the shape and appearance of real-world objects, and methods for their display and manipulation.  These algorithms must take into account the conflicting requirements for real-time interactions and usability by artists and animators, and are built upon a solid mathematical background. Expected Work: Students will design, implement, and use interactive graphical applications (in Java, using the OpenGL API).This amounts to three or four large programming projects and some small assignments. Computer Science graduate students taking this course for graduate credit will have additional programming and possibly written work (which is available to the undergraduates as extra credit).Some of the projects will require using graphical tools (no artistic skill is required). Exams: Midterm and Final. Learning Goals: Computer Science majors ... will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; algorithmic principles). will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field. will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate school), a programming project (for those going into the software industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into startups).

This includes the use of popular software for interacting with and simulating robots, such as the Robot Operation System (ROS). It will provide a view of robots as autonomous agents with a mechanical embodiment, which must observe and act upon their surroundings through the iterative execution of a sensing-planning-actuation loop. On the sensing and perception side, the course will cover state estimation challenges, such as robot localization, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), as well as Bayesian solutions to these problems, such as Kalman and particle filters. For planning and decision making purposes, the course will introduce basic planning and replanning methods, such as A* and D*-like algorithms, the configuration space abstraction, sampling-based planners, and a toolbox of algorithms that solve problems by utilizing these principles. Extensions to multi-robot systems, online planning and handling uncertainty will be touched upon as well. On the control side, the course will offer an introductory coverage of robot kinematics and dynamics, as well as foundational algorithms for trajectory following (e.g., PID).  Course Links: 01:198:206 - Introduction to Discrete Structures II Learning Goals: At the conclusion of the course, students will have a good understanding of the classical computational tools employed in robotics research and applications that relate to perception, decision making and control. On the perception side, students will be able to identify proper models for robot localization tasks and put together implementations that realize these models. For planning, students will be able to build geometric models of simple motion planning problems for mobile robots and apply deterministic and probabilistic search algorithms to solve them. Lastly, students will be able to command the on mobile robots to follow planned trajectories and making corrections on the go through sensor feedback. In addition, students should have an understanding on how these general algorithmic frameworks can lead to solutions of more complex problems involving flying machines, human-robot interaction, mobile manipulators, and multi-robot systems.

Topics include linear models for classification and regression, support vector machines, regularization and model selection, and introduction to deep learning. Application examples are taken from areas like computer vision, natural language processing, information retrieval and others. Machine learning is a vast, fast-changing field. The course is designed to provide a solid starting point by focusing on timeless technical foundations. Students will learn fundamental concepts in the field such as generalization and overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, Bayes optimality, and error decomposition.  Students will also learn how to implement key techniques in the field from scratch including gradient descent, kernel trick, boosting, and expectation maximization. The course content will be delivered by a combination of written assignments that require rigorous proofs and self-contained Python Juypter Notebooks that require completing missing portions and empirically investigating the behavior of models on datasets. The course will reinforce learning with a series of short quizzes throughout the semester.    The course content is designed to be accessible to all SAS students regardless of their majors who have an adequate background in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and programming.  Instructor Profile: Stratos, Karl Prerequisite Information: Although the course has CS 206 as one of the pre-requisites, which requires M 152 (Calculus II), it does not require students to have an in-depth knowledge of integration. Thus, this prerequisite can be replaced by alternative classes on probability in Mathematics or Statistics.  Expected Work: To assess if students have a suitable technical background, there will be a short entrance quiz on linear algebra, calculus (differentiation only), and probability. To make this serious but not too impactful on the grade, it will count as 5% of the final grade.  To assess that students have acquired basic literacy in all the concepts, tools, and techniques they are taught, they will be given 3 short quizzes periodically through the semester.  There will be five assignments each given 2 weeks to complete. The assignments are designed to be challenging but rewarding. Collaboration is allowed and encouraged as long as students (1) write their own solutions entirely on their own, and (2) specify names of student(s) they collaborated with in their writeups. The students will need to digest and reformulate the lecture content in order to successfully complete the assignments. Discussion about assignment problems on Canvas is encouraged.  There will be a final exam to assess the student’s ability to put together the concepts and tools they have learned in the course. The quizzes and the written assignments will provide sufficient preparation for              Exams: Grade Evaluation Entrance quiz			5% Quizzes				15% Assignments			50% Final Exam			30%  Notes: The course is focused on basic principles of machine learning. In particular, students must implement everything from scratch (i.e., using Python/NumPy only, no Scikit/PyTorch/TensorFlow). This will require a true understanding of core machine learning techniques, which are mostly used as black box tools in existing CS courses such as 210 (Data Management in Data Science) and 439 (Introduction to Data Science). Thus the course can serve as a natural follow-up for students who have used these techniques in 210 or 439 and want to understand their underlying principles more deeply. Another major distinction from 210 and 439 is that the course has no data preparation or analysis components. The course assumes that data is given and is only concerned with representation, modeling, estimation, and model selection for general prediction problems. It will thus reinforce and complement existing classes and they will eventually lead to a track for a Data Science major.

The course will cover theories, principles, and practices of traditional neural networks and modern deep learning. The topics of the course are structured into four-fold: (i) Fundamentals of Machine Learning, (ii) Neural Networks, (iii) Modern Deep Learning, and (iii) Applications and Advanced Topics. For the fundamentals of machine learning, we will briefly review basic concepts and principles of machine learning to prepare for the learning of the main topics of the course. In the second part, the course will cover foundational topics of neural networks. This includes topics such as feed-forward neural networks, backpropagation, recurrent neural networks, and LSTMs. Next, we will cover the modern deep learning methodologies. This includes advanced CNN architectures for computer vision, attention mechanisms, transformers, etc. Lastly, we will also touch some advanced topics such as deep generative models, deep reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, etc.. This advanced topics can be changed depending on the instructor.  An important learning goal of the course is to learn practical implementation skills along with the above concepts, principles, and methodologies. For this, the course will have a series of programming assignments and quizzes. Through the final project, students will have a chance to use all learned knowledge and skills to solve practical problems through team collaboration. The course content is designed to be accessible to all SAS students regardless of their majors who have an adequate background in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and programming. Although the course has CS 206 as one of the pre-requisites, which requires M 152 (Calculus II), it does not require students to have an in-depth knowledge of integration. Thus, this prerequisite can be replaced by alternative classes on probability in Mathematics or Statistics.    Instructor Profile: Ahn, Sungjin Prerequisite Information: Prerequisites: M 250 (Introductory Linear Algebra), CS 112 (Data Structures), CS 206 (Introduction to Discrete Structures II) OR M 477 (Mathematical Theory of Probability) OR S 379 (Basic Probability Theory) Learning Goals: The course objectives are (1) to understand the principles of deep learning and its capabilities and (2) to acquire practical skills to design, implement, and train practical deep learning systems. At the end of the course, students will have knowledge of the fundamentals of neural networks and modern deep learning. With this knowledge, the student will be able to use deep learning models or develop new architectures to solve practical real-world problems such as computer vision and natural language processing. In particular, students will become familiar with one of the most popular deep learning programing frameworks based on Python. The exposure to some research topics in the latter part of the course will also encourage students’ interest in research of this topic. Thus, students will be prepared to have a relevant experience for their next career either in industry or academia.

Independent Study in Computer Science   Course Number: 01:198:493 Course Type: Undergraduate Semester 1: Fall Semester 2: By Arrangement Credits: 1 to 4 Description: To enroll in an independent study, a student must find a faculty member to sponsor the project.  Students are encouraged to approach individual faculty based on their interests, although many of these projects get started after a student takes a course with a particular faculty member.  Many students use this as an opportunity to get involved in research, which helps prepare a student for graduate school. Setting up an independent study involves agreeing on a topic, and preparing a one-page outline of the intended study area. The Independent Study form must be completed by the student and the faculty member, and approved by the Department Chair or Undergraduate Chair.  Click here for the form. The faculty member will monitor the work, evaluate the final product, and assign a grade.   Topics: Students whose project ideas are not currently part of any course syllabus, may be interested in setting up an independent study.  The faculty sponsor will likely have their own research interests in the student effort, and the project will be of interest to both.  In general, the 1-4 credits granted will be equivalent in effort and academic content to a regular classroom course, though certainly more specialized, and with perhaps a larger experimental component. Expected Work: The structure of the work in an independent study varies.  It typically consists of activities such as reading, programming, modeling, experimentation, and writing. Learning Goals: Computer Science majors ... will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; algorithmic principles). will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field. will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate school), a programming project (for those going into the software industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into startups). Notes: This course can be used to satisfy a CS upper-level elective requirement (this must be agreed upon in advance). The course number is 493 in the fall, and 494 in the spring.

Students must already have completed the three core courses in the Certificate program, and must have either completed or be concurrently enrolled in a domain course for the Certificate in order to register for this course. The course is meant to be a largely independent empirical project which makes concrete use of all aspects of data science explored in the core and possibly in domain course, from identifying a data source, cleaning and organizing the data, conducting appropriate statistical analysis, to interpreting and reporting the results of the study in a standard scholarly form. Finding an appropriate project and data source with suitable characteristics for a data science-oriented study is an important component of the course. For example https://ourworldindata.org/policy-responses-covid, with over 40 attributes and nearly 50,000 records could provide a good basis for data analysis, prediction, hypothesis testing. This can lead to exciting data driven presentation. Students can find/propose data sets (subject to approval by the instructor) or work with default data set provided by instructor. Students will have to demonstrate skills learned in DS certificate classes such as data wrangling, statistical data analysis including application of machine learning methods and database management skills, plotting and visualization as well as telling the story with the data.  Prerequisite Information: Prerequisites: 01:198:142/01:960:142 (Data 101/Data Literacy), 01:960:291 (Statistical Inference for Data Science) and one of the following: 01:198:210 (Data Management for Data Science), 01:960:295 (Data management and wrangling with R), or 04:547:221 (SCI Data management course). Expected Work: The class will meet once a week for 80 minutes during the last 10 weeks of the semester (this is a 1-credit course, so this is the appropriate number of class meetings). Most class periods will consist of progress reports and updates by students on the various stages of their projects. Ideally an appropriate topic and at least one feasible data source will have been identified by the first class meeting, so that progress in transforming the data into a usable form, preliminary visualization and summary “sizing up” of the nature of the data, appropriate statistical analyses, and so forth, many commence in short order. Final presentations of projects will be done in the last few weeks of the class, and the final report on the project will be due on the scheduled final exam date for the class. There will be no exams, but completion of necessary progress at regular checkpoints during the semester will be required. Exams: Written report plus final presentation of results. Learning Goals: The learning objectives of the course correspond to the broadly stated learning goals for the Certificate in Data Science. The completed project should exhibit an overall synthesis of these learning goals for a particular research topic: Students will be able to  1. Visualize (plot) data relationships in meaningful ways. 2. Transform and map data (otherwise called data wrangling) from one ""raw"" data form into another format for further analysis, querying, learning, and prediction. 3. Acquire data management skills such as database design and database querying. 4. Execute data analyses with professional statistical and machine learning software. 5. Understand the conceptual basis of analyses used in data science. 6. Apply data science concepts and methods to solve real-world problems. 7. Back up a story with data as well as critique conclusions which are not justified by the data.

Degree	 The B.S. Degree in Computer Science has the following requirements: Admission to the major. Six required courses in computer science: 01:198:111, 112, 205, 206, 211, 344. Three required courses in mathematics: 01:640:151, 152, 250. Seven electives from a designated list of courses in computer science and related disciplines. At least five of the electives must be taken in the New Brunswick Department of Computer Science (i.e., they must be 01:198:xxx).  Physics courses 01:750:203,204,205,206 (or 123,124,227,229; or 271,272,275,276; or 201,202; or 193,194), or Chemistry courses 01:160:159,160,171 (or 161,162,171; or 163,164,171). No more than one grade of D can be accepted in courses applied toward the major. Residency condition: At least seven of the (required and elective) courses used to satisfy the requirements of the BS degree must be courses taken in the New Brunswick Department of Computer Science. (i.e., they must be 01:198:xxx.) All CS electives required for the BA/BS degree must be completed in the last 10 years from the date of the undergraduate degree These requirements can be satisfied with 68-71 credit hours (depending on whether 3 or 4 credit electives are taken.) Notes: The above requirements apply to all current computer science majors. Prior to fall 2011, the BS required either 01:198:113 or 214, plus 314 and 416. Students now have the option of substituting other electives for these courses. Courses for which a student receives a grade of D cannot be used to satisfy prerequisite requirements. Requirements to register for CS graduate classes is available on the CS Honors page.
